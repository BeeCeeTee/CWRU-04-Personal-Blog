# Personal Blog






## I. Description
This site allows a user to input a title, content and their username, and view the last few blog posts on the next page. This project uses multiple pages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dynamically create and style a personal blog. 

## II. Usage
To use, simply click the link below or enter the following URL into the address bar:



Enter some text into the form, press the 'Submit' button, and the site will re-direct to the second page, where you can view the blog posts. To return to the form page to submit another blog entry, click the 'Back' button in the upper right of the page. The 'Theme' button can also be pressed to toggle between light and dark mode.
